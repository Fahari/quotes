## Description

 Quotes is a web-application that is meant to solely host quotes. By default, it's populated by some variations of quotes that a visitor can view. A visitor has the ability to up-vote(like) a quote and to down-vote(dislike) a quote. Quotes goes further to add a functionality that allows a visitor to add his/her desired quotes and vote on them.
 A visitor also has the ability to delete any quote he/she has added and feels shouldn't belong.
 Quotes is built entirely in Angular.js and TypeScript.
